{"title": "Hey guys, today I'm going to show you how to make the easiest baked salmon recip", "text": " Hey guys, today I'm going to show you how to make the easiest baked salmon recipe. This recipe really is foolproof. It takes less than 20 minutes to make and it gives you an incredibly moist, flaky and flavorful salmon. This is hands down the salmon recipe that I make most often in my house and it just makes for an easy, healthy dinner recipe that you can serve with a variety of sides. So let me show you how to make it. On Instagram I asked you if you wanted to see the salmon recipe with individual fillets or one large half a salmon and individual fillets one. So that's what I'm using today. But just know that you can use the same recipe on one large piece of salmon as well. Take the salmon out of the fridge and let it come to room temperature for about 15 minutes before cooking. For the same reason that we do this for chicken or steak, it just helps to ensure that the salmon will cook evenly. I always cook salmon with the skin on as it's much easier to remove it after the salmon has cooked and today I'm using these gorgeous and thick King Salmon Follets. I talk about the different varieties of salmon on a separate blog post on my website and I'll link to that below. But King Salmon is known for being thick, super moist and having a buttery smooth texture and that's because it has a higher fat content. It's the most expensive variety of salmon and definitely a splurge but it's so good. Of course, this recipe works just as great with cojo and sake salmon. So just grab what's in season, what's in your budget or what you have access to. And lastly for the individual fillets, try to keep them about the same size so again, they're more apt to cook evenly in the oven. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and then get a baking dish or rim to baking sheet out. I like to lay down parchment papers so that the salmon removes easily but to be honest because we're cooking the salmon at a gentle temperature, it rarely sticks either way. Some recipes say to cook salmon at a high temperature like 425 degrees Fahrenheit but I prefer 375 for extremely moist and succulent salmon that's less likely to overcook and dry out. So place the fillets in your baking dish and once that's done, set them aside. Melt two tablespoons of butter and I just do this in the microwave for about 20 seconds. You want it melted but not hot and certainly not spattering or exploding in your microwave. So 10 to 20 seconds usually does the trick. And then to that you'll add half a tablespoon or so of lemon juice. I don't usually measure this, I just squirt the juice from a quarter slice of a lemon straight into the bowl and catch any seeds in my hands. The measurement usually ends up close enough. Stir the lemon butter mixture together and then brush it generously all over the salmon. And if you don't have a brush, you could just spoon it over the top as well. Next, mince or finely chopped 3 garlic cloves and then sprinkle them all over the top of the salmon. I suppose you could also stir this in with the butter mixture if you don't want garlicky hands but I've always just sprinkled it on top so that it's evenly spread out. And if you are worried about garlicky hands, there's a few really simple tricks to removing that garlicky smell. Like rubbing salt and baking soda between your hands, rubbing coffee grounds between them, or rubbing your hands on something stainless steel like a pot or utensil. Even rubbing your hands on a stainless steel sink works if you happen to have one. But once your garlic is nicely dappled all over the salmon, sprinkle the top with salt and cracked black pepper. You can lay those extra lemon slices all around the salmon. I don't have a lot of extra room today as my salmon pieces are so big, but once these lemon slices have baked, they're soft and juicy and great for squirting on top of the salmon. Bake the salmon for 12 to 15 minutes depending on the thickness of your salmon. And always, always set a timer so that you don't accidentally forget about it because you don't want it overcooked. While the salmon is baking, I'll quickly chop up some fresh herbs. Now, if you're wondering why I didn't add them to the salmon before going in the oven, it's because fresh herbs can burn quickly. Parsley is a little bit more durable, but dill will singe pretty fast, and then you'll have burned dill bits on top, and that's not very tasty. So it's best to just sprinkle the fresh herbs on top of the salmon when it comes out of the oven for the freshest flavor, and I'm chopping up about a teaspoon each of parsley and dill. When the salmon comes out of the oven, it should look juicy and moist, and the color will be a soft, orangey pink. You might also notice some white bits coming out of the salmon. Many people think that this is fat, but it's not. It's called albumin, and it's actually protein that sort of pushes out of the salmon as it's heated up in cooks. Different varieties of salmon and different cooking methods will affect how much albumin you see, but a more gentle oven temperature, like what we're using today, helps to reduce it, and keep the salmon more moist. Long story short, it's totally normal and safe, but you can always scrape it off the sides before serving as well. Now is the time to put the finishing touch on the baked salmon and sprinkle those fresh herbs. The simple combination of garlic, butter, lemon, and herbs is a classic, and it pairs so well with a variety of different sides. Today, I'm serving it up with creamy mashed potatoes and green beans, and both of these recipes are on my website as well. You'll know the salmon is perfectly cooked when it flakes easily with a fork, and it's still moist on the inside. King salmon is great because even if you slightly overcook it, it stays so darn juicy and tender. It really is full proof. Oh, and don't forget to squirt a little bit of lemon juice on top, which I almost forgot, and then dig into this healthy dinner. I hope you enjoyed this recipe, and if you did, make sure to give it a thumbs up, share it with your family and friends, and I will see you again in the next video.", "steps": ["Hey guys, today I'm going to show you how to make the easiest baked salmon recipe.

{"title": "Tica is a type of kabab and what makes it tica tica is it's cooked in a tandoor ", "text": " Tica is a type of kabab and what makes it tica tica is it's cooked in a tandoor which is a traditional clay oven which goes up to thousands of degrees. I think the air fryer is a great substitute for a tandoor. It replicates the similar cooking style because it's fast hot dry heat and it sort of gives you the same result that a tandoor does. I developed this recipe because I think with the air fryer you can make restaurant quality chicken tica at home. To start we're going to make the marinade for the chicken tica. I'm going to add a little bit of ginger and this is finally graded on a microplane and then garlic quite a bit of garlic followed by yogurt. The yogurt is an essential part of this marinade. It acts as a tenderizer. It's thickened so it clings to the chicken and it holds on to all of the spices and coats the chicken well as it cooks. Some lemon juice. The lemon juice also in some ways acts as a tenderizer because it's an acidic ingredient. Then a little bit of the neutral oil and I like adding oil to the marinade because it helps everything brown a little bit and it prevents the marinade from drying out as it cooks in the air fryer. And now for all of the dry ingredients in the spice mixture. The first one is going to be very controversial but I use curry powder. I admit it's very unconventional. There is nothing like curry powder in India but for accessibility reasons I think it's a great shortcut to getting a lot of different flavors into this marinade. And the brand that I actually like is a Japanese curry powder called SMB. I'm going to add paprika. A lot of recipes for chicken tica you will see had red food coloring but I like to use sweet paprika because I think it gives you that same sort of deep red hue in a natural way. And also it adds a nice groutiness from the pepper. I also have some ground pian which adds a little bit of spice. Cardamom. This wakes everything up sort of like a punctuation in the marinade. And then my final drying ingredient is going to be salt. I'm going to just stir the marinade together to make sure all of the spices are dissolved and well combined. Like all grilled meats I think the chicken tica benefits from being marinated. I like to say I'm in about 15 minutes but ideally it would be marinated overnight. And the longer rest gives the yogurt and the spices a chance to act on the meat. The yogurt tenderizes the meat, the spices absorb and flavor the meat. I'm using boneless skinless chicken thighs. I think this is a superior cut when being grilled or in like a high heat application such as the air fryer. Chicken thighs are naturally fatty and they can hold up to being cooked for a while without turning dry. And it might be tempting to use a boneless chicken breast. But if you want the ideal amount of char on the outside while retaining juicy meat on the inside I highly recommend chicken thighs. I am just stirring everything around making sure the thighs are well coated in the marinade. My chicken is ready. I'm going to rest it for about 15 minutes and then we'll be ready for the air fryer. So I have my air fryer preheating. It's at 400 degrees and my chicken has been marinating for 30 minutes and I'm ready to cook. The first cook is about 10 minutes so I set the timer for 15 just to give it five minutes of preheating time. I think it helps cook the food a bit more evenly and cooks it faster. I'm going to lightly grease the bottom of the air fryer. Most air fryer do have a nonstick coating. They don't tend to stick but yogurt is sometimes susceptible to being a little stubborn so a little bit of oil on the bottom is an extra entrance. I'm placing the chicken trying to get them all in a single layer. If the chicken overlaps instead of lying in a single layer it'll steam rather than char. The chicken is in and the air fryer is at 400 and I've set the timer for 10 minutes for the first cook. What's happening inside is all of the elements have heated up and they're emitting heats but there's a fan on top of the air fryer which is circulating and in doing so it's pushing this hot air across the air fryer basket and it's ensuring that more hot air reaches this chicken more evenly which translates into a deeper color and a faster cook. The wily does work much like a convection oven because if it's size and shape it is just so much more effective at cooking and doing the things a convection oven could do. There are a few different kinds of air fryer styles out there. The basket style which is the one I'm using here and toaster oven style air fryer's which are very much like a toaster oven basket style air fryer are typically much smaller and the cooking chamber is able to retain heat much more effectively than in a toaster style air fryer even though the temperature might be the same and they still have a fan the air doesn't quite hit the food at the same rate as a basket style air fryer because if it's size and shape I find the basket style air fryer charz and cooks food much more effectively than a toaster oven. This cooking technique of employing the air fryer isn't just relevant to chicken tikka it's also great for other smaller cuts of meat that are great on the grill and thinking of sausages for instance or Korean style short ribs any kind of kabobs these are all great in the air fryer these are about ready to flip oh very nice so I'm really happy with the color that I have you can see like bits of char the yogurt marinade has sort of crusted over in the nicest way the dry air sort of removed muscle moisture from that yogurt marinade and it's from like a nice film on top but mostly I'm very excited about all of those little bits of char because that's flavor now I'm going to flip these and the cook on the second side is very brief mostly just to cook the chicken through and not really for color I'm going to put this back in again at 400 for maybe five to seven minutes okay the chicken is done cooking see how well charred that is that's flavor and that is as close as you're ever going to get to making tandoor style food at home in your air fryer yeah crispy chari bits I think the chicken tikka looks really good lots of pockets of char the marinade is dried out in the most pleasing manner but the chicken is still extremely juicy and that's thanks to using chicken thighs instead of chicken breast to serve this chicken tikka I do a very simple side salad just cucumber thinly sliced red onion and wedges of lemon I actually like to go ahead and squeeze the lemon on top because I think it really sort of freshens everything up and wakes up all of those flavors okay I cut these cucumbers in a very specific way I think cucumbers are best enjoyed when they're cutting very elongated spears okay perfect a little wedge of lemon and I like to serve it with either non or pita bread and today I have pita bread looks great really nice amount of char the chicken looks very juicy I like the cucumber and onion on the side I'm going to cut in and have a bite the chicken is still very juicy not at all overcooked you can see that it's juicy you can see how the marinade is clinging to the meat and all of those little pockets where it's charred a bit more so I'm excited to try this I love that the spices feel really balanced it looks like it would be very spicy and there is a hint of spice but it's not overwhelming in any way when there's a nice bit of tartness from the combination of yogurt and lemon and the chicken is still quite juicy this is proof that an air fryer is for more than just reheating frozen snacks the fact that you can make restaurant quality chicken tikka at home in the air fryer never sees it's still amazing", "steps": ["Tica is a type of kabab and what makes it tica tica is it's cooked in a tandoor which is a traditional clay oven which goes up to thousands of degrees.

The lemon juice also in some ways acts as a tenderizer because it's an acidic ingredient. Then a little bit of the neutral oil and I like adding oil to the marinade because it helps everything brown a little bit and it prevents the marinade from drying out as it cooks in the air fryer. And now for all of the dry ingredients in the spice mixture. The first one is going to be very controversial but I use curry powder. I admit it's very unconventional. There is nothing like curry powder in India but for accessibility reasons I think it's a great shortcut to getting a lot of different flavors into this marinade. And the brand that I actually like is a Japanese curry powder called SMB. I'm going to add paprika. A lot of recipes for chicken tica you will see had red food coloring but I like to use sweet paprika because I think it gives you that same sort of deep red hue in a natural way. And also it adds a nice groutiness from the pepper. I also have some ground pian which adds a little bit of spice. Cardamom. This wakes everything up sort of like a punctuation in the marinade. And then my final drying ingredient is going to be salt. I'm going to just stir the marinade together to make sure all of the spices are dissolved and well combined. Like all grilled meats I think the chicken tica benefits from being marinated. I like to say I'm in about 15 minutes but ideally it would be marinated overnight. And the longer rest gives the yogurt and the spices a chance to act on the meat. The yogurt tenderizes the meat, the spices absorb and flavor the meat. I'm using boneless skinless chicken thighs. I think this is a superior cut when being grilled or in like a high heat application such as the air fryer. Chicken thighs are naturally fatty and they can hold up to being cooked for a while without turning dry. And it might be tempting to use a boneless chicken breast. But if you want the ideal amount of char on the outside while retaining juicy meat on the inside I highly recommend chicken thighs. I am just stirring everything around making sure the thighs are well coated in the marinade. My chicken is ready. I'm going to rest it for about 15 minutes and then we'll be ready for the air fryer. So I have my air fryer preheating. It's at 400 degrees and my chicken has been marinating for 30 minutes and I'm ready to cook. The first cook is about 10 minutes so I set the timer for 15 just to give it five minutes of preheating time. I think it helps cook the food a bit more evenly and cooks it faster. I'm going to lightly grease the bottom of the air fryer. Most air fryer do have a nonstick coating. They don't tend to stick but yogurt is sometimes susceptible to being a little stubborn so a little bit of oil on the bottom is an extra entrance. I'm placing the chicken trying to get them all in a single layer. If the chicken overlaps instead of lying in a single layer it'll steam rather than char. The chicken is in and the air fryer is at 400 and I've set the timer for 10 minutes for the first cook. What's happening inside is all of the elements have heated up and they're emitting heats but there's a fan on top of the air fryer which is circulating and in doing so it's pushing this hot air across the air fryer basket and it's ensuring that more hot air reaches this chicken more evenly which translates into a deeper color and a faster cook. The wily does work much like a convection oven because if it's size and shape it is just so much more effective at cooking and doing the things a convection oven could do. There are a few different kinds of air fryer styles out there. The basket style which is the one I'm using here and toaster oven style air fryer's which are very much like a toaster oven basket style air fryer are typically much smaller and the cooking chamber is able to retain heat much more effectively than in a toaster style air fryer even though the temperature might be the same and they still have a fan the air doesn't quite hit the food at the same rate as a basket style air fryer because if it's size and shape I find the basket style air fryer charz and cooks food much more effectively than a toaster oven. This cooking technique of employing the air fryer isn't just relevant to chicken tikka it's also great for other smaller cuts of meat that are great on the grill and thinking of sausages for instance or Korean style short ribs any kind of kabobs these are all great in the air fryer these are about ready to flip oh very nice so I'm really happy with the color that I have you can see like bits of char the yogurt marinade has sort of crusted over in the nicest way the dry air sort of removed muscle moisture from that yogurt marinade and it's from like a nice film on top but mostly I'm very excited about all of those little bits of char because that's flavor now I'm going to flip these and the cook on the second side is very brief mostly just to cook the chicken through and not really for color I'm going to put this back in again at 400 for maybe five to seven minutes okay the chicken is done cooking see how well charred that is that's flavor and that is as close as you're ever going to get to making tandoor style food at home in your air fryer yeah crispy chari bits I think the chicken tikka looks really good lots of pockets of char the marinade is dried out in the most pleasing manner but the chicken is still extremely juicy and that's thanks to using chicken thighs instead of chicken breast to serve this chicken tikka I do a very simple side salad just cucumber thinly sliced red onion and wedges of lemon I actually like to go ahead and squeeze the lemon on top because I think it really sort of freshens everything up and wakes up all of those flavors okay I cut these cucumbers in a very specific way I think cucumbers are best enjoyed when they're cutting very elongated spears okay perfect a little wedge of lemon and I like to serve it with either non or pita bread and today I have pita bread looks great really nice amount of char the chicken looks very juicy I like the cucumber and onion on the side I'm going to cut in and have a bite the chicken is still very juicy not at all overcooked you can see that it's juicy you can see how the marinade is clinging to the meat and all of those little pockets where it's charred a bit more so I'm excited to try this I love that the spices feel really balanced it looks like it would be very spicy and there is a hint of spice but it's not overwhelming in any way when there's a nice bit of tartness from the combination of yogurt and lemon and the chicken is still quite juicy this is proof that an air fryer is for more than just reheating frozen snacks the fact that you can make restaurant quality chicken tikka at home in the air fryer never sees it's still amazing"], "num_steps": 1, "tags": []}
